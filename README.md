# Github_web-scraping

## Introduction to Web Scraping:
Web scraping is the automated process of extracting data from websites. It involves retrieving information from web pages, parsing the HTML or XML code, and extracting the desired data for analysis or storage. Web scraping is commonly used in various fields, such as data mining, research, price comparison, and monitoring.

## Introduction to GitHub:
GitHub is a popular web-based platform for version control and collaboration that allows developers to host and manage their software projects. It provides a wide range of features, including code hosting, issue tracking, pull requests, and project management tools. GitHub also includes a feature called "Topics," which categorizes repositories based on different subjects or themes.

## Problem Statement:
The task at hand is to scrape the GitHub Topics page (https://github.com/topics) and create CSV files for the top 30 topics. Each CSV file should contain information about the top 20 repositories related to the respective topic. The required information for each repository includes the name, username, number of stars, and URL.

## Tools Used:
To accomplish this task, we will be using the following tools:

- Python: Python is a widely used programming language known for its simplicity and versatility. It provides a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that are helpful in web scraping tasks.

- Requests: Requests is a popular Python library used for making HTTP requests. It allows us to send HTTP requests to a specified URL and retrieve the response.

- Beautiful Soup: Beautiful Soup is a Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It provides convenient methods for navigating and searching the parsed data, making it ideal for web scraping tasks.

- Pandas: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library in Python. It provides data structures and functions for efficiently working with structured data, such as CSV files. We will use Pandas to create and write the scraped data into CSV files.
